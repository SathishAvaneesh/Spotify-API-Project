# Spotify-API-Project

This project is designed to be a simple replication of the recomended songs function on spotify. 

This is a backend project that I have created to understand and better use the Spotipy API extension that spotify allows developer access too
To use it, create a spotify dev account and put the credentials in the given spots.
